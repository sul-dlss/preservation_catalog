# This file contains the record creation calls needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# it should be safe to run this repeatedly, as the methods it calls only add new entries from the configs,
# and leave existing entries untouched.
# this should be run very infrequently, and lots of other data relies on what's seeded here, and PG is pretty
# efficient about locking strategy, so use the strictest transaction isolation level (serializable):
# http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/DatabaseStatements.html#method-i-transaction
