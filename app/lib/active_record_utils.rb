  # Process all results of the given AR relation, batch_size records at a time (runs the given block on each result).
  # Somewhat similar purpose to find_each and similar methods, but with two big differences:
  # - Respects the order of the given relation
  # - Grabs the *first* batch_size results on every while loop iteration.  The assumption is that the given block
  #   will update each record such that the query won't return it on the next iteration (e.g. relation is a query
  #   for objects that need to be fixity checked, and the block marks each object it encounters as checked). In
  #   other words, the "window" doesn't advance over the result set on each iteration, rather the result set
  #   is expected to "lose" the previously processed results on each iteration.

    # if other processes are modifying the database."
