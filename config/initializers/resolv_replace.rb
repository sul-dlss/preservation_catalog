# The default Socket.getbyhostname and other libc-bound DNS resolutions in Ruby block the entire VM until they complete.
# In a single thread this doesn't matter, but it can cause competition and deadlock in multi-threaded environments.

# It is a monkey-patch, but obviously one provided and supported by the Ruby maintainers themselves.
