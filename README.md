### Setting up PostgreSQL

#### 1. Installing Postgres

If you use homebrew you can install PostgreSQL by typing  `brew install postgresql` into the command line.

Make sure Postgres starts every time your computer starts up.
`brew services start postgresql`

Check to see if Postgres is running.
`postgres -V`

#### 2. Configuring Postgres

The `psql` utility, which lets you carry out admin functions.

Enter `psql postgres` into the command line.
Create your username and password by entering the following into the command line.
`CREATE USER 'your_username' WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';`

Next create the name of your database.
`CREATE DATABASE 'name of database';`

Grant superuser privileges so you can create and drop database.
`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE 'database name' TO 'your_username';`
`ALTER USER 'your_username' WITH SUPERUSER;`
